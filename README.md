# BNTA Frontend Project

This was a seven day group project as part of the BNTA bootcamp where we had to create a frontend application using a backend API that was created from another group during the BNTA Backend Project.

## The API

The API revolves around the Dungeon and Dragon's game and stores information on players, spells, classes, schools, etc.
<br>
It allows users to perform CRUD operations on a database to store and manipulate information.
<br>
More information about the API and pathways/endpoints can be found [here](http://...).

## The Planning

On the first day (Friday 26th December 2021) we spent the whole day planning out our design using the website (Miro) and assigning tasks using Github's built in projects.
<br>
For modelling, we created an outline of how our design would look like, and the key features that each section would have.
<br>
Before the end of the work day, we would all come together in a group call and talk about what we had done and how we would move forward with the project. After, we would plan our next goals around what we needed to do next.
